# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the key factors that influence passenger satisfaction in the airline industry. While many assume that travel experience alone dictates customer ratings, this study investigates potential hidden elements that also impact evaluations. By understanding these factors, airlines can enhance their services and refine their strategic improvements to maintain competitiveness.

## Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to determine the factors associated with passenger satisfaction and predict whether a passenger is satisfied with an airline's services. The study employs multiple analytical techniques to achieve this objective.

## Methodology
To analyze passenger satisfaction, we utilize the following machine learning methods:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **LASSO Regression**
- **RIDGE Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Boosted Trees**

Each method is thoroughly assessed to determine its effectiveness in evaluating and interpreting key satisfaction factors. The insights gained from this analysis help airlines tailor their improvement strategies to better meet passenger expectations.
